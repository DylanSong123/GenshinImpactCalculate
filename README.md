# GenshinImpactCalculate

原神伤害计算器，为了可以更加详细的计算，不同武器、不同圣遗物造成的伤害从而编写出来的。

平常和朋友有谈论伤害的习惯，所以有计算伤害的习惯，之前我是通过matlab来计算的，最近一上头，就用Java写了这个程序。

业余时间更新，Java初学者，如果有不好的，希望可以指出。

"Genshin Impact" damage calculator program I wrote in my spare time. In order to be able to more detailed comparison of different weapons or other things to get revenue.

I used Matlab to figure out how much damage I could do, and then I had an idea that I could write a calculator in Java, and so I did it.

I am a Java beginner, limited technology, hope to be able to like.
